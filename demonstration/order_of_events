PDP and PEP are set up independently (according to network infrasturcture)
-> mutually authenticatd
-> up to implementation
% DONE

PEP connected to PDP
-> check for mandatory params to fit, if not, up to organisation -> e.g. due to versioning -> old PEP may not support all params
PEP could provide more Params

-> PEP sends access request
-> PDP checks whether all mandatory params are present (new)
-> PDP checks validity of mandatory params (new)
-> PDP may request remaining params (new)

-> PEP sends change of any parameter to PDP (new)
-> PDP follows organisation policy for change of params (new)
    -> may trigger re-authorisation
    -> abort
    disallow connection
