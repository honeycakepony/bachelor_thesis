This repository is used for my code base which I use for my bachelor thesis on improving the interoperability of some components, namely Policy Enforcement Point and Policy Decision Point, within a Zero Trust Architecture. 
For this, I'm building upon the Special Publication from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the ongoing effort of the Authorization API, which is currently developed by the AuthZen Working Group as part of the OpenID Foundation.
The code in this repository is experimental and represents my current state of my bachelor thesis.
