<h1>Purpose of this Repository</h1>
This repository is used for my code base which I use for my bachelor thesis on improving the interoperability of some components, namely Policy Enforcement Point and Policy Decision Point, within a Zero Trust Architecture.<br />
For this, I'm building upon the [Special Publication from the National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture) and the ongoing effort of the [Authorization API](https://openid.github.io/authzen/authorization-api-1_1_01), which is currently developed by the AuthZen Working Group as part of the OpenID Foundation.<br /> 
<b>Note</b>: The code in this repository is experimental and represents my current state of my bachelor thesis.
